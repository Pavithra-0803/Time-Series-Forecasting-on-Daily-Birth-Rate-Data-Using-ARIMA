# 📈 Time Series Analysis of Daily Birth Data using ARIMA

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting daily birth rates using Time Series techniques in Python, especially the **ARIMA model**. It involves importing, visualizing, and modeling data to understand trends and make future predictions.

## 📌 What I Have Done in This Project

### ✅ Data Preparation
- Imported the dataset using `pandas`
- Checked for null values and cleaned the data
- Converted the date column into a datetime format
- Set the date as the index for time series analysis

### ✅ Visualization
- Plotted the birth data over time using `matplotlib`
- Observed trends and seasonality patterns

### ✅ Time Series Modeling
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets
- Built an ARIMA model using the `statsmodels` library
- Trained the model with parameters: `order=(1,1,1)`
- Forecasted future values
- Compared predicted values with actual data

### ✅ Evaluation
- Plotted forecast results
- Understood how well the model fits the historical data
